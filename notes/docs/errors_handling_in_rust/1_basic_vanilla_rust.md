# Error Handling in Rust

Error handling in Rust is all about being safe, clear, and efficient. Rust has some cool tricks up its sleeve to help you handle errors gracefully. Let’s dive into how Rust tackles errors and throw in some technical terms along the way.

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### 1. Result Type

Rust's `Result` type is your go-to for functions that might fail. It's an enum with two variants:
- `Ok(T)` for when things go smoothly.
- `Err(E)` for when things go south.

```rust
fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        Err("Cannot divide by zero".to_string())
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}
```

**Algebraic Data Type (ADT)**  
The `Result` type is an ADT, a composite type made by combining other types.

### 2. Option Type

When you’re not sure if you’ll have a value, use the `Option` type. It’s an enum with two variants:
- `Some(T)` for when you have something.
- `None` for when you don’t.

```rust
fn get_element(vec: Vec<i32>, index: usize) -> Option<i32> {
    if index < vec.len() {
        Some(vec[index])
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

**Algebraic Data Type (ADT)**  
Just like `Result`, `Option` is an ADT.

### 3. Error Propagation

Rust’s `?` operator is a neat way to handle errors. If something goes wrong, `?` returns the error to the caller.

```rust
fn read_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let contents = std::fs::read_to_string(filename)?;
    Ok(contents)
}
```

**Monad**  
The `Result` type in Rust is a monad. Monads are about chaining operations that can fail. The `?` operator is like the monadic bind in functional programming.

### 4. Custom Error Types

Creating custom error types gives you more control and context over your errors.

```rust
use std::fmt;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum MyError {
    Io(std::io::Error),
    Parse(std::num::ParseIntError),
}

impl fmt::Display for MyError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            MyError::Io(e) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", e),
            MyError::Parse(e) => write!(f, "Parse error: {}", e),
        }
    }
}

impl From<std::io::Error> for MyError {
    fn from(err: std::io::Error) -> MyError {
        MyError::Io(err)
    }
}

impl From<std::num::ParseIntError> for MyError {
    fn from(err: std::num::ParseIntError) -> MyError {
        MyError::Parse(err)
    }
}
```

**Type Conversion**  
The `From` trait helps convert one type to another, making it easier to turn standard errors into custom error types.

### 5. Panic and Unwinding

Sometimes things are just too broken to handle. That’s where `panic!` comes in. It terminates your thread with an error message.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("This is a panic!");
}
```

**Stack Unwinding**  
When a panic happens, Rust unwinds the stack, cleaning up as it goes. You can control this behavior in `Cargo.toml`.

## Best Practices

- Use `Result` for recoverable errors.
- Use `Option` for values that might not be there.
- Use `?` to keep your error handling concise and clean.
- Create custom error types for better error management.
- Avoid panics in libraries; use them sparingly in application code.

Stick to these practices, and your Rust code will handle errors like a pro: robust, clear, and maintainable.
